# Baby server

This is a simple web interface to an sqlite backend written in python. The interface permits inserting and editing records.

To edit a record click on a row or simply enter its id in the id field and edit the rest of the data.

Run simply by `python baby_server.py <port>`. This starts a server listening on a specified port (default 52666).

Navigate your browser to `<hostname>:<port>` and start editing your data in the web form.
